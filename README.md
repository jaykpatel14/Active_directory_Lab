**Project Background: Building an Active Directory Lab with a Cybersecurity Focus
**

Active Directory is a tool developed by Microsoft to simplify the management of users and assets within organizations. Today, almost every organization relies on Microsoft Active Directory for user and computer management. As a cybersecurity student and aspiring professional, I realized that learning about Active Directory hands-on would be far more beneficial than merely reading documentation and books. Hence, I decided to build an Active Directory lab from a cybersecurity perspective.

**Benefits of Active Directory:**

Centralized Data Repository: Stores identity information of users, applications, and resources.

Replication of Data: Data is replicated across multiple domain controllers.

Security: Centralized authentication and authorization.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this lab is to practically apply the concepts I’ve learned as a cybersecurity student. Additionally, I aim to explore how to detect various attacks using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

**Tools:**

VMWare (hypervisor)

Windows Server 2019 (AD server)

Windows 10 (Client)

Splunk on Ubuntu OS (SIEM)

Kali Linux (Attacker)

**Background: **

In this project, we’ll simulate an organization named marvel.local that supports law enforcement in saving the world. The organization comprises three departments: Avengers, Guardians, and X-Men. A competitor of marvel.localhas hired a hacker named Thanos to disrupt the organization.

**Lab Setup:**

Primary Domain: marvel.local

Client Machine: Windows 10

SIEM System: Splunk

Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
